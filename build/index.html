                <p>
                    &emsp;My portfolio is a display of my personal and academic growth during my four years at RCHS.
                    Each assignment and project included was carefully chosen to represent the development of my work
                    ethic and competence as I get ready to start my journey in higher education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;Over the past four years at Riverview, I have grown academically and personally. As a shy
                    freshman, I remember what it was like to leave English class stressed out from the vigorous amount
                    of homework and studying just assigned. Although I was apprehensive, with the support of my teachers
                    and family, I was able to learn study habits that work for me in order to succeed academically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;The assignments I have chosen represent my growth as a student in various subjects over the
                    years. RCHS has given me the opportunity to make significant growth in the subject that I'm most
                    passionate in: programming. An early programming project I included is called Hacker Hacker, and it
                    is a simple game that I submitted my freshman year. The other programming project in my portfolio,
                    Drobe, is the product of my junior independent study. It's a functioning mobile application that
                    incorporates complex topics like sorting algorithms and data quantification. Without the support of
                    the amazing teachers and staff at Riverview, such growth in my work would not be possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;In the fall, I plan on attending the University of Michigan to study computer science. I want
                    to use code to make everyday life easier. At the University of Michigan, I'll be working side by
                    side with innovators who lead the way in technology. Though I still have a lot to learn, I'm
                    thankful for the opportunities that Riverview has provided me to grow both academically and
                    personally. RCHS has prepared me to succeed in college by teaching me that success is a product of
                    hard work and resilience. Yes, RCHS taught me to be a better student, but more importantly, it
                    taught me the importance of getting up and trying again.

            <p>This is a simple game written in Microsoft Small Basic. While starting a program in an old MS-DOS style
                terminal, something goes wrong! There are 247 bugs detected, and now you must enter the source code and
                destroy them. Battle for your health and fight to win power-ups as you defeat each error. Lose all your
                health and the game is over, but if you kill all 247, you win!</p>

            <p>Drobe is a smart clothing application built with React Native and TypeScript. Its purpose is to keep
                track of your war<strong style="color:#8c64ff">drobe</strong> and to help plan your next outfit. Drobe's
                main purpose is to give you new, stylish outfit recommendations daily. When you don't know what to wear,
                Drobe will create a new outfit for you by knowing what clothes you own and when you wear them. Using
                clothing attributes like color, warmth, and level of formality, the app can find the best outfits in
                your wardrobe in just a tap. As Drobe's first development period ends I accomplished a lot, but there's
                still a lot of work to do.</p>
